# CsvReader
Basic Java Program that reads from a sample CSV (enrollmentFile.csv), sorts the records, filters them, and prints back to a CSV, output.csv.

Unzip the CsvReader.zip file, open in IntelliJ (or a similar IDE), verify/change the contents of enrollmentFile.csv as needed, run the main method in the CsvReader class. Verify the contents of the resulting CSV file, output.txt, for correctness.
